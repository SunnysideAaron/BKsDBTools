# BKsDBTools (Bam Kaplam's Database Tools)
BKsDBTools is a set of tools to very rapidly work with a relational database. Primarily built around .xlsx (spreadsheets) and python. BKsDBTools is a hack! That said, it is one of **the fastest** ways to setup a complete database solution. Including _repeatable_ imports and exports, table creation, table pre population, data editing, and reporting.

Further documentation can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/SunnysideAaron/BKsDBTools/wiki).
